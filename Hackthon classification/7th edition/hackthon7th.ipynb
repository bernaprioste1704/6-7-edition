    "# üõí **Mission: Save the E-Commerce Empire!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**  \n",
    "Attention, aspiring data scientists! You've just been recruited by a leading e-commerce company facing a major crisis. Customers are leaving‚Äîchurning faster than you can say ‚Äúfree shipping.‚Äù The marketing team is panicking, the sales team is stressed, and the CEO is counting on *you* to figure out what‚Äôs going on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge: **Can you predict which customers are likely to churn?** With this knowledge, the company can take action to retain their most valuable customers, offer targeted discounts, and keep their loyal shoppers happy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you‚Äôll be working with contains customer behavior details, including their preferred payment methods, time spent on the app, order history, and even their satisfaction scores. Your mission is to analyze this data, uncover the secrets behind customer churn, and build a predictive model to save the day. Think you‚Äôve got what it takes? Let‚Äôs dive in and find out!  \n",

    "## **Dataset**  \n",
    "The dataset contains detailed information about e-commerce customers, their preferences, and their activity. Each row represents a customer, and the columns describe various attributes related to their behavior. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.  \n",
    "- **Churn**: Flag indicating whether the customer has churned (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  \n",
    "- **PreferredLoginDevice**: The device most often used by the customer to log in (e.g., mobile, desktop).  \n",
    "- **CityTier**: Tier of the city where the customer resides (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2).  \n",
    "- **WarehouseToHome**: Distance between the warehouse and the customer‚Äôs home.  \n",
    "- **PreferredPaymentMode**: The customer‚Äôs preferred payment method (e.g., credit card, digital wallet).  \n",
    "- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.  \n",
    "- **HourSpendOnApp**: Number of hours the customer spends on the app or website.  \n",
    "- **NumberOfDeviceRegistered**: Total number of devices registered by the customer.  \n",
    "- **PreferredOrderCat**: The preferred category of orders placed by the customer in the last month.  \n",
    "- **SatisfactionScore**: The customer‚Äôs satisfaction score with the service.  \n",
    "- **MaritalStatus**: Marital status of the customer.  \n",
    "- **NumberOfAddress**: Total number of addresses saved by the customer.  \n",
    "- **Complain**: Whether the customer raised a complaint in the last month (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  \n",
    "- **OrderAmountHikeFromLastYear**: Percentage increase in order amount compared to last year.  \n",
    "- **CouponUsed**: Total number of coupons used by the customer in the last month.  \n",
    "- **OrderCount**: Total number of orders placed by the customer in the last month.  \n",
    "- **DaySinceLastOrder**: Number of days since the customer‚Äôs last order.  \n",
    "- **CashbackAmount**: Average cashback amount received by the customer in the last month.  \n",

    "## **Timeline**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs your step-by-step roadmap for tackling this dataset. Follow this timeline to stay on track and unlock your inner data scientist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame** *(17:20 - 17:30)*  \n",
    "   - Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows.  \n",
    "   - Check for missing values and data types.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Introductory EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** *(17:30 - 17:50)*  \n",
    "   - Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of key variables like `Churn`, `HourSpendOnApp`, and `OrderCount`.  \n",
    "   - Identify any trends, outliers, or unusual patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Treatment and Training Preparation** *(17:50 - 18:10)*  \n",
    "   - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately.  \n",
    "   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., `PreferredLoginDevice`, `PreferredPaymentMode`).  \n",
    "   - Normalize or scale numerical features like `WarehouseToHome` and `CashbackAmount`.  \n",
    "   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Baseline Model** *(18:10 - 18:30)*  \n",
    "   - Create a baseline predictive model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict churn.  \n",
    "   - Use this as a starting point to evaluate performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model Evaluation** *(18:30 - 19:00)*  \n",
    "   - Evaluate the baseline model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  \n",
    "   - Visualize results with a confusion matrix to understand false positives and negatives.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Iterate and Improve** *(19:00 - 19:30)*  \n",
    "   - Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.  \n",
    "   - Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.  \n",
    "   - Analyze feature importance to identify key factors influencing churn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Final Insights and Recommendations** *(19:30 - 20:00)*  \n",
    "   - Summarize your findings: Which features are most predictive of churn?  \n",
    "   - Create compelling visualizations (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots) to support your insights.  \n",
    "   - Prepare actionable recommendations for the e-commerce team to reduce churn.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Your Challenge**  \n",
    "Can you identify the key factors driving customer churn? Are customers with lower satisfaction scores more likely to leave? Does cashback or coupon usage impact loyalty? By the end of this analysis, you‚Äôll be equipped to predict churn and help the company retain its most valuable customers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck, and let the data guide you! üìä\n"
