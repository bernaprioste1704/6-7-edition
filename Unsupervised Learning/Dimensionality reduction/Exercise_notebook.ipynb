    "# RiceGraininator 5000 Deluxe\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations, aspiring data scientists! You’ve been recruited by none other than Dr. Ingrain Doofennutrientz, the legendary (and slightly misunderstood) inventor, to help bring his latest masterpiece to life: the **RiceGraininator 5000 Deluxe**! This marvelous machine is designed to solve one of humanity’s most pressing issues—accurately identifying rice varieties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Because Dr. Doofennutrientz once lost an all-you-can-eat sushi contest after mixing up Arborio and Jasmine rice. Determined to never face such a mix-up again, he vowed to build the ultimate rice-classifying robot. But alas, the **RiceGraininator 5000 Deluxe** is only as good as its algorithms—and that’s where you come in!  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to train and evaluate the *RiceGraininator 5000 Deluxe* using a carefully curated dataset. This subset consists of **5,000 observations**, with approximately **1,000 grains per rice species**: Jasmine, Basmati, Arborio, Karacadag, and Ipsala. Each grain was meticulously processed to extract **106 features** derived from advanced image processing techniques:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **12 morphological features**  \n",
    "- **4 shape features** derived from morphological characteristics  \n",
    "- **90 color features** from five different color spaces (RGB, HSV, Lab*, YCbCr, XYZ)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to first perform a logistic regression to classify the rice varieties. Then, you will apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce feature complexity and compare the results. Will your algorithm achieve culinary excellence and secure Dr. Doofennutrientz's legacy? Time—and your coding—will tell!  \n",
