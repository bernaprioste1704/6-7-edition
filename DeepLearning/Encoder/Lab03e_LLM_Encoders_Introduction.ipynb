    "# Introduction to the Encoder in Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will learn the fundamentals of the encoder and the attention mechanism using PyTorch. We will explore key concepts such as projection layers, dot products for attention scores, softmax for normalization, and weighted sums of values. By the end of this notebook, you'll have hands-on experience implementing these concepts and understanding how the encoder works in a neural network architecture like transformers.\n",
